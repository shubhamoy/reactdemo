# ReactJS Demo

Outcome of the training on ReactJS by Ben Fhala. I've tried to add few nuts and bolts to streamline the flow. Apart from ReactJS, it also uses [Webpack2](https://webpack.js.org/) and [BabelJS](http://babeljs.io/). The codebase uses ES6 features like [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator).
